- AWS to the rescue!
  1. coding
  2. CFD simulations
  3. publishing

## Coding

- what code do we have? (diagram of repositories)
- WHITEBOARD: code workflow: github, travis-ci, .deb, AWS S3

## Modelling

- example command line for running a simulation, uploading result to s3
- WHITEBOARD: singularity, EC2, S3 bucket

## Publishing

- (no slides)
- WHITEBOARD: download from S3, arxiv, zenodo

## Summary

- AWS EC2 with singularity containers 
- AWS S3 buckets host Debian package repository and simulation results

- A time consuming job needing devops expertise... a job for research software engineers?
- Can computational workflows be implemented more quickly and more simply?
